You’ve prototyped your Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design: It blinks, it speaks, it’s IoT enabled and it breathes fire (maybe it doesn’t breathe fire…). Now it’s time to put that awesome new project of yours into an enclosure. Unfortunately, all you have is a generic project case that appeared to come straight outta the 80’s.

**Introducing: The Koki’o Project Case**

The Koki’o project case is an open frame design which allows for panoramic viewing of your Printed Circuit Board (PCB). That being said, the case also protects the PCB from harmful contact with hands or tools, but allows entry of air and moisture which is great for applications which require environmental exposure (i.e. sensors).  A set of PCB template libraries are available for most major EDA tools (Eagle, Altium, KiCad) right out of the box - no pun intended.
